or targeting by folder

## Create migration

```bash
npm run migrate create "create table <table_name>"
```

## PostgreSQL Database

1. Create User

    ```bash
    CREATE USER <new_username> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<new_username_password>';
    ```

2. Create Database

    ```bash
    CREATE DATABASE <new_database>
    ```

3. Privileges

    ```bash
    GRANT ALL ON DATABASE <new_databases> TO <new_username>;
    ```

   OR

    ```bash
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <new_databases> TO <new_username>;
    ```

4. Database Owner

    ```bash
    ALTER DATABASE <new_databases> OWNER TO <new_username>;
    ```

5. Grant ```public``` schema if needed

   First select database by these command

    ```bash
    \c <new_databases> <root_username>;
    ```

   Then allow user schema ```public``` on selected database

    ```bash
    GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO <new_username>;
    ```

   OR secondary if above unsuccessful

    ```bash
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO <new_username>;
    ```

6. Run migration

   Before run migration make sure both database for both test and release are created.

   ```bash
   npm run migrate up
   ```

   for development (test) create similarly like steps above but with different database and migration command. Before that try to create copy from ```config/database/test.example.json``` called ```test.json```

    ```bash
   npm run migrate:test up
    ```

## JWT (JSON Web Token)

1. Since using Hapi Framework and JWT (JSON Web Token), may install JWT third party library through this command.

   Do not run this if already installed!

    ```bash
    npm install @hapi/jwt
    ```

2. Generate random token using Node RPL, first command

    ```bash
    node
    ```

   then write and run by click enter,

    ```bash
    require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex');
    ```

3. Do it twice for **ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY** and **REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY** of JWT in environment file ```.env```

## Restore 'Immaculate' Project State

- For UNIX based system

  ```bash
  find . -type f -name '*.log' -o -type d -name 'node_modules' | xargs git clean -ff
  ```

- For Windows
  
  Run Batch script ```ForumApiReset.bat``` by double-click on it.
